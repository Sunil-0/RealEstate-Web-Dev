            <h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
            <p>We're a sales performance agency. We've been helping businesses drive revenue with the use of inbound marketing 
            and sales enablement tactics since 2012. We're a proud HubSpot Platinum Partner and pride ourselves on using the best 
            tools to help our clients succeed. Our team is made up of smart and talented people that are passionate about creating 
            inbound sales resultst.</p>

            <h1>WE ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE REST</h1>
            <p>We're rooted in sales. Our parent company, The Center for Sales Strategy (CSS), has been helping sales organizations 
            turn talent into performance for almost 40 years. Unlike other marketing agencies, we're obsessed with ROI and we have 
            the experience to deliver Inbound sales results because we've done it ourselves...</p>
            <p>We've been where you are. More than a decade ago, when we needed to grow and diversify how we generated new business 
            at CSS, we turned to inbound marketing and found huge success after launching our sales strategy blog. Once we mastered 
            the art of using thought leadership content for lead generation, we launched LeadG2 so we could help businesses do the 
            exact same thing</p>
